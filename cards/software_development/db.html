                        <dd>Second normal form To conform to 2NF and remove duplicities, every non-key attribute must
                            depend
                            on the whole key, not just part of it.</dd>

                            dependencies. No non-prime (non-key) attribute is transitively dependent on any key i.e. no
                            non-prime
                            attribute depends on other non-prime attributes. All the non-prime attributes must depend
                            only on the

                        <dd>Boyce-Codd normal form A relational schema R is considered to be in BoyceCodd normal form
                            (BCNF) if, for
                            every one of its dependencies X → Y, one of the following conditions hold true:
                            X → Y is a trivial functional dependency (i.e., Y is a subset of X) X is a superkey for
                            schema R</dd>

                        <dd>Fourth normal form Whereas the second, third, and BoyceCodd normal forms are concerned with
                            functional dependencies, 4NF is concerned with a more general type of dependency known as a
                            multivalued
                            dependency. A table is in 4NF if and only if, for every one of its non-trivial multivalued
                            dependencies
                            X ↠ Y, X is a superkey—that is, X is either a candidate key or a superset thereof.</dd>

                        <dd>Fifth normal form Fifth normal form (5NF), also known as project-join normal form (PJ/NF),
                            is a level
                            of database normalization designed to reduce redundancy in relational databases recording
                            multi-valued
                            facts by isolating semantically related multiple relationships. A table is said to be in the
                            5NF if and
                            only if every non-trivial join dependency in that table is implied by the candidate keys. A
                            join
                            dependency *{A,
                            B, …, Z} on R is implied by the candidate key(s) of R if and only if each of A, B, …, Z is a
                            superkey for
                            R.

                            table is in 6NF
                            when the row contains the Primary Key, and at most one other attribute".</dd>
